# ðŸ“¦ Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [0.5.0]

- Add any_as_unknown config option to use `unknown` instead of `any` for the `Any` type from Python. This is now the default behavior [#2](https://github.com/semohr/py2ts/issues/2).

## [0.4.1]

### Fixed

- Support for edge cases in TypeScript interface generation, specifically when an interface has no elements but inherits from another type. This ensures that the generated TypeScript code is valid and does not produce empty interfaces.

## [0.4.0] 

### Added

- Support for excluding fields from TypeScript types using the `exclude` method. This only works for `TSComplex` types, such as `TSInterface`, `TSRecordType`, and `TSEnum`. The builder also now supports excluding fields when adding types.
