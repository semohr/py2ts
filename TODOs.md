# TODOs

Small list of todos for the project. Feel free to have a look if you want to contribute!

- [ ] Add support for `Class` methods
    At the moment it is possible to generate types for classes, but not for their methods. This would be a nice addition to the project as it should be possible with python reflection.

- [ ] Add cli interface
    It would be nice to have a cli interface to generate types from the command line. This would make it easier to integrate the project into other projects.

- [ ] Add `export` keyword to generated types
    At the moment the generated types are not exported. This means that they can not be used in other files. It would be nice to add the `export` keyword to the generated types so that they can be used in other files.
